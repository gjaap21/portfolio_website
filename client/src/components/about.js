        <p className='aboutDescription'>I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in Mechanical 
        Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I plan to graduate in June of 2025 and 
        hope to learn as much as I can before then. I'm comfortable using Python, C, Typescript, 
        Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Git, and Assembly, but I'm always willing to expand my skillset and 
        work on new projects! Here is a copy of my <a className='resume' href={resume} target='_blank'
